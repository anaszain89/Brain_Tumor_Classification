# Brain Tumor Classification

## Repo for tumor classification/segmentation project

Evaluation of different types of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms continues to be a critical diagnostic challenge. Due the heterogeneity of such tumors, it is often difficult to distinguish between the different classes of tumors. In particular, distinguishing between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor, and metastases (METS), which arise from tumors outside of the brain, is extremely important, as the management and treatment are vastly different. This often requires a stereotactic brain biopsy which carries a small yet significant risk. There is a hence need for improved strategies for non-invasive diagnosis of brain tumors.

In this project, we will therefore analyze the MRI scans from individuals with the two tumor categories and build a pipeline to perform the classification. 

Some initial results were presented at [RSNA 2017](https://rsna2017.rsna.org/program/?showModal=20DCE35F-8658-4E55-9A8F-77427F2B63D4).

A more extended version of this study has been accepted for presentation at *SPIE Medical Imaging 2019*.
